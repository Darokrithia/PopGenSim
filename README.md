# PolygenSim
Simulates polygenic evolution of quanitative traits in
Digital Genomes aka Degnomes

# GenAnceSim
Sister program of Polygensim.  Very similar with slight
changes that stop mutation and give more informaiton on the
genetic contributions of each ancestor

# Devosim
Subject to being renamed.  A more general program that can
do the job of GenAnceSim and PolygenSim at the same time via
a modified dengome that stores fitness and ancestry
in different arrays.

# Change Log
As well as git commits, I will be keeping track of progress
of the program in the change log.  It will not contain every
change and will be more high level.  The most recent changes
are at the top, and the oldest ones are at the bottom.
Version A.B.C means that it is the Cth update to the Bth
patch of of the Ath major release.  Most releases will change
B, small tweaks will change C, and a major release will be
change A.

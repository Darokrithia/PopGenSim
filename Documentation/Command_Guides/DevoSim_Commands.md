```-b```

- Simulation will stop when all degnomes are identical.

```-c chromosome_length```

- Set chromosome length for the current simulation.

- Default chromosome length is 10.


```-e mutation_effect```

- Set how much a mutation will effect a gene on average.

- Default mutation effect is 2.


```-g num_generations```

- Set how many generations this simulation will run for.

- Default number of generations is 1000.

```-h ```

- Displays this guide in program.

```-m mutation_rate```

- Set the mutation rate for the current simulation.

- Default mutation rate is 1.


```-o crossover_rate```

- Set the crossover rate for the current simulation.

- Default crossover rate is 2.

```-p population_size```

- Set the population size for the current simulation.

- Default population size is 10.

```-r```

- Only show percentages of descent from the original genomes.

```-s```
